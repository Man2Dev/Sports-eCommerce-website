# Collaborative Development Process

1. Each student works on their assigned issues/feature branches.
2. When changes are stable, they merge those changes into their own branch.
3. Two students then take turns running the merged code in their local systems to ensure it works with the rest of
the codebase and doesn't cause any integration issues.
4. If code passes those checks, a pull request is made to merge that student's changes into master at the agreed
upon time (e.g., between 10pm-11pm).
5. The sprint reviews will involve showing the final working results in your local environment, demonstrating what
was done.
