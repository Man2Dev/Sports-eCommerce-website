# Git Development Process

1. Each team member works on their assigned issues/feature in their respected branches.
2. When the team member changes are stable, then they do a pull request (pr) for those changes into their own branch.
3. Two team members then review and test the pr in their local systems to ensure it works with the rest of the code-base and doesn't cause any integration issues.
4. If code passes those checks, the pull request is merged that team members branch. 
5. All the team members branches will then be merged into the main branch.
**Note: all merges are to be done only in merge window of(between 10pm-11pm).**
